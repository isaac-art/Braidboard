## Braidboard
#### current version: 0119b

<hr>

This began as a sort of hardware version of [BriadLab](https://github.com/isaac-art/BraidLab) but is becoming some kind of cellular moving image organism or distributed display thing.
Influenced in some ways by [T2Tile](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1M91QuLZfCzHjBMEKvIc-A) but doing different less ambitious things.

Playing with pattern swatches as cells.

### Activity

-[08/02/19] plan for the next week is to work on a font for drawing with. a set of tiles that can connect into different patterns.

- [08/02/19] playing around with images, thinking of having little pattern swatches for the screens, will need to make some bitmaps/font. they can then infect each other flipping bits of the weaves in each other?

- [01/02/19] simple version running, 4 possible states, inherit from parents and pass to child. Next try drawing the knot crossings instead of numbers.

### Requirements
* using the convenience of arduino, as i can use the arduino as isp to program the attinys
* for drawing to the screen i am using [datacute's Tiny4kOLED Library](https://github.com/datacute/Tiny4kOLED/) but i might strip it down some more if i end up needing to

<hr>


### Hardware
* pcb 0119b[front](https://github.com/isaac-art/Braidboard/blob/master/BOARD/0119b/braidboard_front.png) and back [back](https://github.com/isaac-art/Braidboard/blob/master/BOARD/0119b/braidboard_back.png)
* attiny84 (0119b using SOIC footprint) - [datasheet](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/8006S.pdf)
* OLED 128x32 I2C - the four pin type you find on [ebay](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/IIC-I2C-0-91-128x32-white-OLED-LCD-Display-Module-3-3v-5v-For-Arduino-PIC-HC/173751114146?hash=item28745f99a2:g:lKYAAOSwu05bQsUy:rk:1:pf:1&frcectupt=true)
* a bunch of breadboard spaced header pins & sockets
* power from a socket, or can use coin cells, i'm gonna try get it hooked to a solar panel
* i am avoiding making any enclosures at the moment

<hr>

### Specs
* attiny84 has 8k of space which should be plently for the first braid animation tests
* 3V-5V
* 12mm x 40 mm tiles - not sure how deep they are yet till i assemble one, should sit pretty flush but we'll see how they go

<hr>

### Futures
* bigger IC ?
* smaller IC !
* bigger/smaller screen ?
* colour ?
* add 20Mhz xtal ?
